# Bullet_Point 

This is a repository for my WIP personal project game currently called Bullet Point written in C++ and OpenGL. 
It uses my 2D game engine called LKengine.

Currently Implemented:

* CSV loader for loading the level from CSV's output created from the software "Tiled".
* Tilesheet texture loading.
* Audio for music and sound effects of guns, footsteps etc.
* Zombies with basic movement towards player.
* Character movement and animation of reloading, walking.
* Collision detection.
* Basic HUD elements showing such as health and ammo.
* Guns with different parameters (AK, shotgun and pistol) and a smoke grenade.
* Wave spawning system of enemies.
* Particle systems - currently implemented for the blood splatter when enemies are shot and for the smoke grenade smoke.
